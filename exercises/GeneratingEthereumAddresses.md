# Generating Ethereum Addresses

In this exercise, we will choose a private key and generate the associated public key and Ethereum address from this private key using the *openssl* command line program.

Ethereum uses the [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)] for validating the origin and integrity of messages. In particular, Ethereum uses the mathematical constants defined in the [secp256k1 standard]. See [What is the math behind elliptic curve cryptography?] for more details on the maths. See [How are ethereum addresses generated?] for a description of this process.

**Note** that this is not a recommended way to generate your keys. This exercise just demonstrates the relationship between the private key and the associated Ethereum address.

### Private Key

The private key in Ethereum is a 32 byte (or 256 bit) random number with a range from 1 to 8^32 (or 2^256). Not all numbers in this range form a valid private key. From [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/cab1cff11cbcd4ff60f1a149deb71ec87413b487/crypto/crypto.go#L114-L116) `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` is the first valid number. From [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/cab1cff11cbcd4ff60f1a149deb71ec87413b487/crypto/crypto.go#L38) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/cab1cff11cbcd4ff60f1a149deb71ec87413b487/crypto/crypto.go#L110-L112) `fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141` is the maximum number.

**Note** that it is very important that your real private keys are generated from a secure random number generator - see [Secure Cryptocurrency Seeds] and [Why shouldn't we roll our own?].

The [Ethereum Private Key Database] provides a list of 32 private key / Ethereum address pairs per page in  3618502788666131106986593281521497120401173883721090761956411348172442546699 pages. Click on a few Ethereum address on the first page and check if there are any ethers in these accounts.

We will choose the last private key from the first page of [Ethereum Private Key Database] for this exercise - `000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001f` - the associated Ethereum address for this private key is `0x6b09D6433a379752157fD1a9E537c5CAe5fa3168`.

### Generate Public Key

From [How to convert an ECDSA key to PEM format], we want to add the prefix `302e0201010420` before the private key and add the postfix `a00706052b8104000a` after the private key. Our hex string is now `302e0201010420000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001fa00706052b8104000a`.

On OS/X with *openssl* installed, run the following command. See [Command Line Elliptic Curve Operations] for further information on *openssl*. The Unix [xxd](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-xxd/) command converts the hex string into binary form to be piped into *openssl* [DER](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/DER) format.

```bash
$ echo "302e0201010420000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001fa00706052b8104000a" | xxd -r -p - | openssl ec -inform der -noout -text
read EC key
Private-Key: (256 bit)
priv: 31 (0x1f)
pub: 
    04:6a:24:5b:f6:dc:69:85:04:c8:9a:20:cf:de:d6:
    08:53:15:2b:69:53:36:c2:80:63:b6:1c:65:cb:d2:
    69:e6:b4:e0:22:cf:42:c2:bd:4a:70:8b:3f:51:26:
    f1:6a:24:ad:8b:33:ba:48:d0:42:3b:6e:fd:5e:63:
    48:10:0d:8a:82
ASN1 OID: secp256k1
```

The `04` prefix and colons need to be removed from the *pub* key above to form the public key `6a245bf6dc698504c89a20cfded60853152b695336c28063b61c65cbd269e6b4e022cf42c2bd4a708b3f5126f16a24ad8b33ba48d0423b6efd5e6348100d8a82`.

Using the `geth console` JavaScript command, we calculate the [Keccak]-256 hash of the public key. See [Which cryptographic hash function does Ethereum use?] for more details on keccak-256.

```javascript
> web3.sha3("6a245bf6dc698504c89a20cfded60853152b695336c28063b61c65cbd269e6b4e022cf42c2bd4a708b3f5126f16a24ad8b33ba48d0423b6efd5e6348100d8a82", {encoding: 'hex'});
"0x37c33922dc113a7af93268576b09d6433a379752157fd1a9e537c5cae5fa3168"
```

You can also use the [Online SHA-3 Keccak Calculator], setting *Hash Size* to **256**, *Function* to **Keccak**, *Format* to **Hex**, pasting the public key into the *Message* text box and clicking *Calculate*.

We need to take the last 20 bytes (40 hex characters) of the keccak-256 hash to compute the Ethereum address:

```javascript
> web3.sha3("6a245bf6dc698504c89a20cfded60853152b695336c28063b61c65cbd269e6b4e022cf42c2bd4a708b3f5126f16a24ad8b33ba48d0423b6efd5e6348100d8a82", {encoding: 'hex'}).substring(26);
"6b09d6433a379752157fd1a9e537c5cae5fa3168"
```

The generated Ethereum public key is `6b09d6433a379752157fd1a9e537c5cae5fa3168`. Compare this to the public key from the [Ethereum Private Key Database] of `0x6b09D6433a379752157fD1a9E537c5CAe5fa3168` and note that some of the alphabetic hexadecimal characters are uppercase. [EIP-55 Mixed-case checksum address encoding] describes the mix-case checksum algorithm.

And we can import the private key into `geth` to verify that the same Ethereum address is generated (output of UTC file formatted manually):

```bash
$ geth --datadir=./test account import privatekey
INFO [08-10|11:50:46.823] Maximum peer count                       ETH=25 LES=0 total=25
